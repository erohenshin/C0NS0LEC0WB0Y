A 2D game engine written in C.  This is way outdated now.

I'm probably no longer going to be working on this.  I'm recycling useful bits in a new engine I'm working on, but I've decided that this code isn't very well-written in general due to my original intentions when I started the project.  I'll probably clean up and push the latest version of the code here when I feel like it.
